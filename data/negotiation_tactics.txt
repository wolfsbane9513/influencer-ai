# Negotiation Tactics & Phone Scripts

## Opening Scripts by Scenario

### Standard Introduction
"Hi [Creator Name], this is Alex calling from [Brand Name]. I hope I'm catching you at a good time! We have an exciting [Campaign Type] campaign that would be perfect for your [Platform] audience of [Follower Count] followers. Your [Engagement Rate]% engagement rate is exactly what we're looking for. Do you have 3-4 minutes to discuss a collaboration worth around $[Initial Offer]?"

### High-Value Creator (Mega-influencer)
"Hi [Creator Name], this is Alex from [Brand Name]. I'm reaching out because we specifically identified you as our top choice for an exclusive [Campaign Type] campaign. Your content quality and [Engagement Rate]% engagement with [Follower Count] followers makes you perfect for this premium collaboration. Are you available to discuss a partnership in the $[Initial Offer] range?"

### Time-Sensitive Campaign
"Hi [Creator Name], this is Alex from [Brand Name]. I'm calling because we have an urgent but exciting opportunity that I think would be perfect for you. We need to move quickly on this [Campaign Type] campaign, but we're prepared to offer premium rates - around $[Initial Offer] for [Deliverables]. Do you have a few minutes to discuss?"

## Objection Handling Scripts

### "Your price is too low"
**Response Options:**
1. "I understand your concern. Looking at your engagement rate of [X]% and average views of [Y], I can see the value. Given those strong metrics, I could go up to $[Max Budget]. How does that sound?"

2. "You're absolutely right about your value. Your cost-per-view of $[Cost Per View] is actually excellent compared to industry standards. Let me see what I can do - I could offer $[Higher Amount] plus a performance bonus if we hit engagement targets."

3. "I appreciate your position. Your content quality score of [X] definitely warrants premium pricing. What if we structured this as $[Base Rate] plus a 15% bonus for hitting our view targets?"

### "Timeline is too tight"
**Response Options:**
1. "I completely understand - quality content takes time. What if we extended this to [Alternative Timeline]? Would that work better for your content creation process?"

2. "That's totally fair. We could either extend to [X weeks] or reduce the scope to just [Primary Deliverable] to meet the original timeline. Which would you prefer?"

3. "Good point. Since it's a rush timeline, we could add a 20% rush premium, bringing it to $[Increased Amount]. Would that make the tight timeline work?"

### "I need to think about it"
**Response Options:**
1. "Of course! This is a big decision. Just to help with your consideration - the campaign launches [Date], so we'd need to hear back by [Deadline]. Is there anything specific I can clarify to help your decision?"

2. "Absolutely, take your time. While you're considering, would it help to know that we're also planning a follow-up campaign in [Timeline] that we'd love to discuss? This could be the start of a longer partnership."

3. "That makes sense. Before I let you go, is there anything about the terms - price, timeline, or deliverables - that's giving you pause? I might have some flexibility."

## Value Proposition Scripts

### Highlighting ROI
"Based on your analytics, this campaign would give us a cost-per-view of $[X], which is excellent value in the [Niche] space. Your engagement rate of [Y]% means we're reaching a highly active audience."

### Long-term Partnership Angle
"We're not just looking for a one-off collaboration. Based on your content quality and audience engagement, we're hoping this could be the first of several campaigns throughout the year."

### Performance-Based Incentives
"What if we structured this with a base rate of $[X] plus a 20% bonus if we hit [Specific Metric]? This way, if your content performs as well as we expect, you earn extra."

## Closing Scripts

### Soft Close
"Based on everything we've discussed - $[Final Price] for [Deliverables] with delivery by [Timeline] - does this sound like something you'd be interested in moving forward with?"

### Urgency Close
"We're finalizing our creator lineup by [Date]. If you're interested, I can get the contract over to you today. Should I send that your way?"

### Summary Close
"Perfect! Let me confirm: $[Price] for [Detailed Deliverables], delivered by [Timeline], with [Usage Rights]. I'll email you the contract within 2 hours. Thank you for the great conversation!"

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't Say:
- "This is our final offer" (unless it really is)
- "Everyone else is doing it for this price"
- "We can find someone else easily"
- "You should be grateful for the opportunity"
- "That's way too expensive"

### Do Say:
- "Let me see what I can do"
- "I understand your position"
- "Your content quality is exactly what we need"
- "Based on your metrics..."
- "How can we make this work for both of us?"

## Emergency Responses

### When You Don't Know Something
"That's a great question. Let me connect you with my team lead who can give you the exact details on that. Can I have them call you back within the hour?"

### Technical Issues
"I think we might have a poor connection. Can you hear me clearly? If not, I'd be happy to call you right back."

### Creator Becomes Upset
"I completely understand your frustration, and I want to make sure we resolve this. Your time is valuable, and I appreciate you taking this call. Let's see how we can make this work."
